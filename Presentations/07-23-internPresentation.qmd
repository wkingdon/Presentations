## The Microbit {.center}
![](/Presentations/img/microbit.png)

:::{.notes}
This is the BBC Microbit, a single board computer designed to teach the basics of programming by making learning more engaging and accessable with real world results. 
As you can see it as a full set of features.
:::

## Isn't that for children?
:::{.fragment}
 - Well, yes.
 - ![](/Presentations/img/codeblocks.png)
 - But...
:::

:::{.notes}
 - Most of the information for the Microbit is aimed at people at the very beginning and children 
 - As such much of the code is very simple and uses codeblocks 
 - Only a teaching tool
 - Not sufficient for computer science degrees
:::
## CODAL
Component Oriented Device Abstraction Layer

:::{.incremental}
 - Open source project from Lancaster University that supports many SBC
 - System that supports Microsoft makecode codeblocks
 - Written using c
 - Won't compile on the lab machines ...
:::

:::{.notes}
Important that this is  on c as this module must support systems programming/ low level programming as it is a foundation for many different things in SoC

Wont compile on lab machine as the libraries needed to compile for the microbit as a target are not available on arch/centos
:::


## This is a common problem
* Who here has struggled during installation and setup for a new programming language?

:::{.incremental}
 - This is almost always a pain in the ass
:::
## The solution 
:::{.incremental}
 - Github Codespaces
 - Cloud based development environment based on VSCode.
    - This is far more accessible and portable than any other solution I have seen
 - Uses devcontainer system from vscode to allow for an adaptable programming environment.
 - This is a configuration in code system
    - Tools needed to run are included in repo
 - Systems similar to this could be useful many different programming workflows
:::

::: {.notes}
check if they know what git(hub) is
devcontainers provode a layer between the host system and the applications that can interpret code only within vscode
The microsoft devcontainer team creates and updates devcontainers for any popular languages.
Most important outcome of all of this is the flexibility it provides
:::

# Lets see this in action

## Key Takeaways
:::{.incremental}
 - The Microbit allows for forward facing, engaging and innovative teaching.
 - Github Codespaces
    - Allows for innovative teaching modes
    - Creates projects that are highly portable
:::

::: {.notes}
Github Codespaces can be used to create an accessible and portable teaching environment allowing teaching to focus on key concepts and understanding rather than troubleshooting
